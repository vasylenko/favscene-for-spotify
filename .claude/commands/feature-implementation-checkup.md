description: Analyze feature implementation and compare doc description versus actual code and functionality added
---

## Context
You were working on a feature, following the provided documentation or direct detailed request

## Your task

**READONLY** operation

You must now compare the feature doc(s) (or request if provided directly) with the actual implementation you made: the code you added or changed, the functionality you added or chagned, the design, etc 

You must think deep on this and provide summary of any deviations with clear explanations of WHY you decided to did it differently

This is not a punishment or accusation task; this is for both of us to stay on the same page, so be cristal clear and brutally honest.
